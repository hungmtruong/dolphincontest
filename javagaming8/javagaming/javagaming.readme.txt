This zip file contains everything needed to install the "javagaming" library.
In addition to this ReadMe file, it contains the following:

- a text file named "javagaming.classpath.txt" containing the elements which 
  need to be added to the CLASSPATH variable on the machine(s).  

- a text file named "javagaming.path.txt" containing the elements which 
  need to be added to the PATH variable on the machine(s).

- folders containing the RAGE game engine and libraries used by RAGE:
  rage165, jogl, joml, jbullet, jinput, luaj, ode4j, graphicslib3D, and vecmath.

- folders containing the libraries used in the 155 textbook: jogl, joml.


TO INSTALL THE JAVAGAMING LIBRARY:

There are two versions of "javagaming"... one for Java 8 and one for Java 11.
You should install whichever one corresponds to your version of the Java JDK.

  The one for Java 8 is called "javagaming8.zip".
  The one for Java 11 is called "javagaming11.zip".

Before trying to install the "javagaming" libraries, you'll need to MAKE SURE
that you have properly and completely installed a JAVA JDK on your machine.
"JDK" means "development kit".  Open a command window and type:  java -version
If your version is only a JRE, then you'll need to install a JDK before proceeding.

Uncompress either javagaming8.zip or javagaming11.zip depending on your version
of Java.  Regardless of which one you uncompress, after uncompressing there is a
folder inside named "javagaming".  That is the folder that you will use.

1) Place the "javagaming" folder in the location where you wish to install the
   library.  These instructions assume you have placed it at the root of "C:".
   The path files described below also assume this - i.e., that you have created a
   folder called "C:\javagaming".

2) Add the elements given in "javagaming.classpath.txt" to the CLASSPATH variable.
   Note that there are different versions of JOML depending on which version of
   Java you are using:
      Java version 11, use:  joml-1.9.25.jar
      Java version 08, use:  joml-jdk8-1.9.25.jar

3) Add the elements given in "javagaming.path.txt" to the PATH variable.


TO TEST THE INSTALLATION (if using RAGE):

1) download and uncompress the "Dolphin Click" program from your instructor's website.

2) open a new command prompt window (must be a new prompt to inherit the updated paths)

3) migrate to the folder containing the "dolphin click" program.
   Type "compile" and then type "run".
   This should run a program that displays a rotating dolphin in the middle of the screen.
   Pressing the "C" key should increment the counter shown at the lower left.


TO TEST THE INSTALLATION (if using OpenGL/JOGL for CSc-155):

1) download and uncompress the "Environment Mapping" program from your instructor's website.

2) open a new command prompt window (must be a new prompt to inherit the updated paths)

3) migrate to the folder containing the "environment mapping" program.
   Type "compile.bat" and then "run.bat".
   This should run a program that displays a rotating chrome torus with a lake and mountains
    in the background.


Additional notes:

- The PATH and CLASSPATH descriptions in "javagaming.path.txt" and 
"javagaming.classpath.txt" assume that the library is extracted
to "C:\", producing "C:\javagaming" as described above.  If the library is
extracted to a different location then the PATH and CLASSPATH elements in 
"javagaming.path.txt" and "javagaming.classpath.txt" must be adjusted accordingly.

- Linux and MacOSX users must make the appropriate changes to the PATH and
CLASSPATH variables, which are given in Windows format.  Under Linux the native 
library (".so") file paths must be added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
variable (which you will have to create if it doesn’t already exist); under 
Mac OS X they should be added to the DYLD_LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

- The PATH must include the path to a Java 1.8 JDK or Java 11 JDK.
Java JRE is NOT sufficient.

- Using a 32-bit windows machine is no longer recommended.  If you want to try,
then the "javagaming/jinput/lib/jinput-dx8_64.dll" may need to be deleted
(or better, temporarily renamed) and then the file 
"javagaming/jinput/lib/XXXjinput-dx8.dll" renamed to "jinput-dx8.dll".

- Most of the javagaming components include a "javadoc" directory containing the
Java documentation for the component.  To read the documentation, navigate to the
desired "javadoc" directory and open the file "index.html" in a browser.
The JOML javadoc can be found by searching "JOML javadoc" in Google.

- It is recommended that you bookmark the javadocs for RAGE, JOGL, and JOML
in your browser.  You will need to refer to them throughout the course.
